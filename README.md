Repadiography is a tool to facilitate the visual comparison of several repackaged apps with the legitimate repackaged app, allowing: the localization of the altered and added code; the evaluation of the portion of altered or added code; and, finally, to estimation of the alterationâ€™s impact.
For pursuing this goal, Repadiography transforms an Android app into an image, where each code statement corresponds to a strip of colour. The strip colour is determined by a conversion function between the alphabet used for writing the code and the RGB components.
